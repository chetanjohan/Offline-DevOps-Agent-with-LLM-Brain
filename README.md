# Offline-DevOps-Agent-with-LLM-Brain

## Overview
**Offline-DevOps-Agent-with-LLM-Brain** is an offline-first DevOps automation agent powered by a local Large Language Model (LLM) brain. It is designed to help developers and system administrators analyze logs, automate workflows, and perform system operations without relying on internet connectivity.

This project focuses on modularity, extensibility, and offline efficiency.
